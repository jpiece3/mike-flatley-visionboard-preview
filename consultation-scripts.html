          <li>Listen more than you talk (70/30 rule)</li>
          <li>Ask questions before offering solutions</li>

          <li>No pressure, just guidance</li>

                <p><strong>You:</strong> Hi [First Name], this is Sharra from The Gary Mercer Team. You built a Dream Home Wishlist a few days ago and said you're looking to move soon. Do you have 10 minutes to chat?</p>
                <p><strong>[Wait for confirmation]</strong></p>
                <p><strong>You:</strong> Great! I pulled up your wishlist — you're [Profile Name], right? [Style], [Neighborhood vibe], [Must-haves]. Love it.</p>
                <p>Before we dive into listings, can I ask: what's driving your timeline? Are you relocating for work, lease ending, family situation?</p>
                <p><strong>[Listen. This is the most important question.]</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Key Questions to Ask:</strong></p>
                <ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
                  <li><strong>Pre-approval status:</strong> "Have you been pre-approved yet, or is that your next step?"</li>
                  <li><strong>Other agents:</strong> "Are you working with another agent, or just starting your search?"</li>
                  <li><strong>Deal-breakers:</strong> "Is there anything that's an absolute no? Like, you'd walk away from a perfect house if it had X?"</li>
                  <li><strong>Budget reality check:</strong> "You selected [$XXX-$XXX] on your wishlist. Is that where you're comfortable, or were you just exploring?"</li>

              <div class="script-section">
                <h4>Consultation Phase (Minutes 6-8)</h4>
                <p><strong>You:</strong> Okay, here's what I'm thinking. Based on your [Profile] wishlist and your timeline, we should tour 5-7 homes this week or next.</p>
                <p>I've already pulled a list that matches your [must-haves] in [neighborhoods]. Some just hit the market. A couple won't last the week — inventory in your range is tight right now.</p>
                <p><strong>[Show them you've done the work already]</strong></p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 16px;">The market right now:</h4>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                  <li>Inventory is up 20% from last year, so you've got choices</li>
                  <li>Rates are around 6%, which is stable</li>
                  <li>Good homes in your range still move fast, but you have negotiating power</li>
                  <li>We're seeing price reductions and closing cost credits again</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 16px;">How I work:</h4>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                  <li>I'll send you 5-7 properties to review tonight</li>
                  <li>Pick your top 3, and I'll schedule showings</li>
                  <li>We tour together — I'll point out things other agents miss</li>
                  <li>When you find the one, I'll help you craft an offer that wins without overpaying</li>

                <p><strong>[Lock in specific day/time]</strong></p>
                <p><strong>You:</strong> I'll send you the property list by [tonight/tomorrow morning] with my notes on each one. Reply with your top 3, and I'll confirm showing times.</p>
                <p>One more thing: if anything pops up between now and then that matches your wishlist, I'll text you. Sound good?</p>

                <ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
                  <li><strong>Timeline driver:</strong> "What's making you think [3-6 months / next year]? Is it saving for a down payment, waiting for a lease to end, just getting started?"</li>
                  <li><strong>Familiarity with Chester County:</strong> "Are you local, or are you relocating here?"</li>
                  <li><strong>Biggest uncertainty:</strong> "What's the biggest question mark right now? Budget? Neighborhoods? When to start looking?"</li>
                  <li><strong>Pre-approval:</strong> "Have you talked to a lender yet, or is that on your to-do list?"</li>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 16px;">Why starting now is smart:</h4>
                <ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
                  <li>You get to browse without pressure</li>
                  <li>You'll learn what you actually want vs. what you think you want</li>
                  <li>When the right one pops up, you're ready to move</li>
                </ol>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 16px;">What I recommend:</h4>
                <ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
                  <li>Get pre-approved in the next 30 days (even if you're not ready to buy yet)</li>
                  <li>Start casually touring homes — open houses, no appointment needed</li>
                  <li>I'll send you listings that match your [Profile] wishlist once a week</li>

                <p>I'll add you to my monthly market update list. It's not salesy — just "here's what happened in Chester County this month" kind of stuff. You can see what homes are selling for, what inventory looks like, all that.</p>
                <p>If you ever want to know "what could I get for $XXX,XXX in Chester County," just reply to one of those emails. I'll send you examples.</p>
                <p>And if your timeline changes — you get a new job, you inherit money, you win the lottery — call me. I'll help you figure it out.</p>
                <p><strong>[No pressure. Just planting seeds.]</strong></p>

      <div class="card-body">
        <div class="script-section">
          <h4>Objection 1: "I'm already working with another agent"</h4>
          <p><strong>You:</strong> Got it. How's that going? Are they taking care of you?</p>
          <p><strong>[Listen. Most people will vent if they're not happy.]</strong></p>
          <p><strong>If they say it's fine:</strong> "Great. If it's not broke, don't fix it. But if anything changes, keep my number. I'm always here."</p>
          <p><strong>If they hesitate or complain:</strong> "Look, I'm not going to poach you. But if you're not getting the service you deserve, you're allowed to switch. Just saying."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="script-section">
          <h4>Objection 2: "I need to talk to my spouse first"</h4>
          <p><strong>You:</strong> Of course. Should I call back when they're available, or do you want to talk to them first and circle back?</p>
          <p><strong>You:</strong> What's the main thing you need to align on? Budget? Timeline? Neighborhood?</p>

        <div class="script-section">
          <h4>Objection 3: "I'm not sure I can afford Chester County"</h4>
          <p><strong>You:</strong> What price range were you thinking? [Let them state their budget]</p>
          <p><strong>You:</strong> Okay, here's the truth. Chester County median is around $629K, but we've got homes from $300K to $3M. It really depends on what you're willing to compromise on.</p>
          <p><strong>[Pull up 2-3 examples in their budget]</strong></p>
          <p><strong>You:</strong> These are in your range. They might not have everything on your wishlist, but they're real options. Want me to send you a full list so you can see what's possible?</p>

        <div class="script-section">
          <h4>Objection 4: "I'm just not ready yet"</h4>
          <p><strong>You:</strong> Totally fine. When do you think you will be? [Get specific timeline]</p>
          <p><strong>You:</strong> Perfect. I'll check in with you [2 months before that date]. In the meantime, want me to send you listings so you can stay in the loop?</p>
