<h1>Consultation Scripts - Vision Board Follow-Up</h1>

<blockquote>Mike Flatley | The Gary Mercer Team</blockquote>
<blockquote>Conversation frameworks for hot/warm/cool leads from vision board</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>Script Philosophy</h2>

<strong>These are frameworks, not verbatim scripts.</strong> Use your own voice. The goal: diagnose needs, provide value, build trust. Never sound like you're reading.

<strong>Key Principles:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Listen more than you talk</strong> (70/30 rule)</li>
<li><strong>Ask questions before offering solutions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reference their wishlist</strong> (shows you paid attention)</li>
<li><strong>No pressure, just guidance</strong></li>
<li><strong>End every call with a clear next step</strong></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Hot Lead Script (ASAP / Within 3 Months Timeline)</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>
<ul>
<li>They selected "ASAP" or "Within 3 Months" on timeline</li>
<li>Budget $500K+ (serious buyer)</li>
<li>Completed wishlist within last 7 days</li>
</ul>

<h3>Opening (First 60 seconds)</h3>

<strong>You:</strong> Hi [First Name], this is Sharra from The Gary Mercer Team. You built a Dream Home Wishlist a few days ago and said you're looking to move soon. Do you have 10 minutes to chat?

<strong>[Wait for confirmation]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> Great! I pulled up your wishlist — you're [Profile Name], right? [Style], [Neighborhood vibe], [Must-haves]. Love it.

<p>Before we dive into listings, can I ask: what's driving your timeline? Are you relocating for work, lease ending, family situation?</p>

<strong>[Listen. This is the most important question.]</strong>

<hr>

<h3>Diagnosis Phase (Minutes 2-5)</h3>

<strong>Key Questions to Ask:</strong>

<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-approval status:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   "Have you been pre-approved yet, or is that your next step?"</p>
<ul>
<li>If yes → "Who's your lender? Are you happy with them?"</li>
<li>If no → "I've got 3 lenders who move fast. Want an intro?"</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>Other agents:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   "Are you working with another agent, or just starting your search?"</p>
<ul>
<li>If yes → "How's that going? What do you wish was different?"</li>
<li>If no → "Good. Let me tell you how we work."</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>Deal-breakers:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   "I saw your must-haves on the wishlist. Is there anything that's an absolute no? Like, you'd walk away from a perfect house if it had X?"</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen for: school district, commute time, HOA, condition</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>Budget reality check:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   "You selected [$XXX-$XXX] on your wishlist. Is that where you're comfortable, or were you just exploring?"</p>
<ul>
<li>If exploring → Adjust expectations now</li>
<li>If locked in → Confirm what they can get in that range</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Consultation Phase (Minutes 6-8)</h3>

<strong>You:</strong> Okay, here's what I'm thinking. Based on your [Profile] wishlist and your timeline, we should tour 5-7 homes this week or next.

<p>I've already pulled a list that matches your [must-haves] in [neighborhoods]. Some just hit the market. A couple won't last the week — inventory in your range is tight right now.</p>

<strong>[Show them you've done the work already]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> Before we schedule, let me set expectations:

<strong>The market right now:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Inventory is up 20% from last year, so you've got choices</li>
<li>Rates are around 6%, which is stable</li>
<li>Good homes in the [$XXX-$XXX] range still move fast, but you have negotiating power</li>
<li>We're seeing price reductions and closing cost credits again</li>
</ul>

<strong>How I work:</strong>
<ul>
<li>I'll send you 5-7 properties to review tonight</li>
<li>Pick your top 3, and I'll schedule showings</li>
<li>We tour together — I'll point out things other agents miss</li>
<li>When you find the one, I'll help you craft an offer that wins without overpaying</li>
</ul>

<strong>[Pause. Let them process.]</strong>

<hr>

<h3>Closing Phase (Minutes 9-10)</h3>

<strong>You:</strong> Sound good?

<strong>[Wait for yes]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> Perfect. What does your schedule look like this week? Morning, afternoon, or evening?

<strong>[Lock in specific day/time]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> I'll send you the property list by [tonight/tomorrow morning] with my notes on each one. Reply with your top 3, and I'll confirm showing times.

<p>One more thing: if anything pops up between now and then that matches your wishlist, I'll text you. Sound good?</p>

<strong>[Get phone number if you only have email]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> Great. Talk soon, [First Name]. Let's find your home.

<hr>

<h3>Follow-Up Actions (Within 24 Hours)</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Send custom property list</strong> (5-7 homes with agent notes)</li>
<li><strong>Text confirmation</strong> with your direct number</li>
<li><strong>Add to CRM</strong> with "Hot - Tours Scheduled" tag</li>
<li><strong>Set reminder</strong> to follow up if they don't reply in 24 hours</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Warm Lead Script (3-12 Month Timeline)</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>
<ul>
<li>They selected "3-6 Months" or "Next Year" on timeline</li>
<li>May or may not have pre-approval yet</li>
<li>Researching neighborhoods and prices</li>
</ul>

<h3>Opening (First 60 seconds)</h3>

<strong>You:</strong> Hi [First Name], this is Sharra from The Gary Mercer Team. You built a Dream Home Wishlist last week — loved your [Profile Name] selections. Do you have a few minutes?

<strong>[Wait for confirmation]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> I'm not calling to push you to buy tomorrow. I know you said you're [3-6 months / next year] out. I just wanted to introduce myself and see if you have any questions about the Chester County market.

<strong>[Immediately reduce pressure]</strong>

<hr>

<h3>Diagnosis Phase (Minutes 2-5)</h3>

<strong>Key Questions to Ask:</strong>

<ol>
<li><strong>Timeline driver:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   "What's making you think [3-6 months / next year]? Is it saving for a down payment, waiting for a lease to end, just getting started?"</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen for: financial barriers vs. life timing</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>Familiarity with Chester County:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   "Are you local, or are you relocating here?"</p>
<ul>
<li>If relocating → Offer neighborhood guide</li>
<li>If local → "Which neighborhoods are you considering?"</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>Biggest uncertainty:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   "What's the biggest question mark right now? Budget? Neighborhoods? When to start looking?"</p>
<ul>
<li>This tells you what value to provide</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-approval:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   "Have you talked to a lender yet, or is that on your to-do list?"</p>
<ul>
<li>If not yet → "No rush, but I'd do that sooner than later. Want a referral?"</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Consultation Phase (Minutes 6-8)</h3>

<strong>You:</strong> Okay, here's my take. You're [3-6 months / next year] out, which is actually perfect timing. Here's why:

<strong>Why starting now is smart:</strong>
<ol>
<li>You get to browse without pressure</li>
<li>You'll learn what you actually want vs. what you think you want</li>
<li>When the right one pops up, you're ready to move</li>
</ol>

<strong>What I recommend:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Get pre-approved in the next 30 days (even if you're not ready to buy yet)</li>
<li>Start casually touring homes — open houses, no appointment needed</li>
<li>I'll send you listings that match your [Profile] wishlist once a week</li>
<li>When you're 60-90 days out, we'll get serious</li>
</ol>

<strong>[Frame it as low-pressure education, not sales]</strong>

<hr>

<h3>Closing Phase (Minutes 9-10)</h3>

<strong>You:</strong> Sound fair?

<strong>[Wait for yes]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> Cool. I'm not going to bug you. Here's what happens next:

<ol>
<li>I'll send you a Chester County neighborhood guide (matches your [neighborhood vibe] preference)</li>
<li>You'll get weekly listing updates — no spam, just homes that fit your wishlist</li>
<li>When you're 2-3 months out, reply to one of my emails and we'll schedule tours</li>
</ol>

<p>If anything changes and you want to move faster, just call me. If your timeline pushes out, totally fine — just let me know.</p>

<strong>[Give them permission to take their time]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> Questions before I let you go?

<strong>[Answer, then close]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> Perfect. I'll send that neighborhood guide tonight. Enjoy the research phase — it's actually kind of fun when there's no pressure. Talk soon.

<hr>

<h3>Follow-Up Actions (Within 24 Hours)</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Send neighborhood guide</strong> (PDF or link to market snapshot)</li>
<li><strong>Add to weekly nurture list</strong> (email sequence)</li>
<li><strong>Set 60-day follow-up reminder</strong> (check-in call)</li>
<li><strong>Tag in CRM</strong> as "Warm - Nurture Track"</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Cool Lead Script (Just Looking / 12+ Months)</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>
<ul>
<li>They selected "Just Looking" or long timeline</li>
<li>May not be serious buyer yet</li>
<li>Could be dreaming, researching, or very early stage</li>
</ul>

<h3>Opening (First 60 seconds)</h3>

<strong>You:</strong> Hi [First Name], Sharra from The Gary Mercer Team. You built a Dream Home Wishlist — I'm calling everyone who completes it just to say hi. Do you have 2 minutes?

<strong>[Wait for confirmation]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> I saw you picked "Just Looking" for your timeline, which is totally fine. I'm not calling to sell you a house today. I'm just curious: are you actively thinking about buying, or just browsing for fun?

<strong>[Let them tell you where they are]</strong>

<hr>

<h3>Diagnosis Phase (Minutes 2-4)</h3>

<strong>Key Questions to Ask:</strong>

<ol>
<li><strong>Motivation level:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   "On a scale of 1-10, where 1 is 'I was just bored and took a quiz' and 10 is 'I'm ready to move tomorrow,' where are you?"</p>
<ul>
<li>Honest answer tells you how to proceed</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>Barriers:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   "What would need to happen for you to actually buy? Like, what's holding you back?"</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen for: money, timing, job, family, uncertainty</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>Renting vs. owning:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>   "Are you renting now, or do you already own and thinking about moving?"</p>
<ul>
<li>Renter → Education about affordability, programs</li>
<li>Owner → Timeline for selling current home</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Consultation Phase (Minutes 5-6)</h3>

<strong>You:</strong> Got it. Here's what I'll do:

<p>I'll add you to my monthly market update list. It's not salesy — just "here's what happened in Chester County this month" kind of stuff. You can see what homes are selling for, what inventory looks like, all that.</p>

<p>If you ever want to know "what could I get for $XXX,XXX in Chester County," just reply to one of those emails. I'll send you examples.</p>

<p>And if your timeline changes — you get a new job, you inherit money, you win the lottery — call me. I'll help you figure it out.</p>

<strong>[No pressure. Just planting seeds.]</strong>

<hr>

<h3>Closing Phase (Minutes 7-8)</h3>

<strong>You:</strong> Sound okay?

<strong>[Wait for yes]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> Cool. Enjoy the browsing phase. When you're ready, I'm here.

<p>Oh, one more thing — follow us on Instagram (@sharramercer). We post Chester County neighborhood stuff, market updates, behind-the-scenes. It's actually interesting, I promise.</p>

<strong>[Soft social media CTA]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> That's it. Thanks for taking my call. Good luck with the search, whenever that actually starts.

<hr>

<h3>Follow-Up Actions (Within 24 Hours)</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Add to monthly market update list</strong> (low-touch drip)</li>
<li><strong>Tag in CRM</strong> as "Cool - Long Nurture"</li>
<li><strong>Set 6-month follow-up reminder</strong> (check if anything changed)</li>
<li><strong>No immediate follow-up</strong> (respect their timeline)</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Objection Handling Scripts</h2>

<h3>Objection 1: "I'm already working with another agent"</h3>

<strong>You:</strong> Got it. How's that going? Are they taking care of you?

<strong>[Listen. Most people will vent if they're not happy.]</strong>

<strong>If they say it's fine:</strong>
<strong>You:</strong> Great. If it's not broke, don't fix it. But if anything changes, keep my number. I'm always here.

<strong>If they hesitate or complain:</strong>
<strong>You:</strong> Look, I'm not going to poach you. But if you're not getting the service you deserve — like, they're not responsive, they're not strategic, whatever — you're allowed to switch. Just saying.

<hr>

<h3>Objection 2: "I need to talk to my spouse first"</h3>

<strong>You:</strong> Of course. Should I call back when they're available, or do you want to talk to them first and circle back?

<strong>[Give them control]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> What's the main thing you need to align on? Budget? Timeline? Neighborhood?

<strong>[This tells you what the real blocker is]</strong>

<hr>

<h3>Objection 3: "I'm not sure I can afford Chester County"</h3>

<strong>You:</strong> What price range were you thinking?

<strong>[Let them state their budget]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> Okay, here's the truth. Chester County median is around $629K, but we've got homes from $300K to $3M. It really depends on what you're willing to compromise on.

<strong>[Pull up 2-3 examples in their budget]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> These are in your range. They might not have everything on your wishlist, but they're real options. Want me to send you a full list so you can see what's possible?

<strong>[Education > pressure]</strong>

<hr>

<h3>Objection 4: "I'm just not ready yet"</h3>

<strong>You:</strong> Totally fine. When do you think you will be?

<strong>[Get specific timeline]</strong>

<strong>You:</strong> Perfect. I'll check in with you [2 months before that date]. In the meantime, want me to send you listings so you can stay in the loop?

<strong>[Low-commitment offer]</strong>

<hr>

<h2>Script Add-Ons & Personalization</h2>

<h3>If They're a Specific Profile, Use Profile Language</h3>

<strong>The Minimalist:</strong>
<p>"I saw you're a Minimalist — clean lines, smart home, quality over quantity. We've got some great modern homes in West Chester Borough that check those boxes."</p>

<strong>The Nester:</strong>
<p>"You're a Nester, right? Big yard, top schools, room to grow. Have you looked at the Great Valley or Unionville-Chadds Ford school districts yet?"</p>

<strong>The Entertainer:</strong>
<p>"Entertainer profile — love it. I've got a listing with a gourmet kitchen and outdoor kitchen that you need to see. Literally built for hosting."</p>

<strong>The Urbanite:</strong>
<p>"Urbanite = walkable vibes. Are you familiar with Phoenixville's Bridge Street? It's having a moment right now."</p>

<strong>The Retreater:</strong>
<p>"You're a Retreater — peace, privacy, sanctuary. Have you considered Unionville or Kennett Square? Horse country vibes, acreage, rolling hills."</p>

<hr>
