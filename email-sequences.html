<h3>Email 1.2: Introduction to Team (Day 2)</h3>

<strong>Subject:</strong> A little more about us (and Chester County) 👋

<strong>Preview Text:</strong> 401 sales, 563+ reviews, and a love for this area

<strong>Send Timing:</strong> Day 2 (48 hours after signup)

<strong>Body:</strong>

<p>Hi {{first</em>name}},</p>

<p>I'm Sharra, and I lead The Gary Mercer Team here in Chester County.</p>

<p>You created a Dream Home Wishlist a couple days ago ({{profile<em>name}} — great taste!). I wanted to introduce myself and share a little about what makes us different.</p>

<strong>Our Story:</strong>

<p>We're not a boutique brokerage with 10 sales a year. We're not a corporate mill that treats you like a number. We're somewhere in between — high volume (401 homes sold in 2024), but every client gets the strategic attention they deserve.</p>

<strong>Why Chester County?</strong>

<p>We've been here since 2005. We know which school districts are worth the premium, which neighborhoods are about to pop, and where you can still find value. That local knowledge? It's your advantage.</p>

<strong>How We Work:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>No pushy sales tactics</strong> — we're consultants, not closers</li>
<li><strong>Market data, not gut feelings</strong> — we show you the numbers</li>
<li><strong>Strategic and fun to work with</strong> — our Instagram bio, but also our reality</li>
</ul>

<p>When you're ready to tour homes, reply to this email or call me directly: (610) 324-9416.</p>

<p>Until then, enjoy browsing. We'll send you new listings that match your wishlist each week.</p>

<h3>Email 2.2: Market Insight (Day 9)</h3>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Chester County market update (and what it means for you)

<strong>Preview Text:</strong> Rates, inventory, and buyer power in 2026

<strong>Send Timing:</strong> Day 9 (warm/cool leads only)

<strong>Body:</strong>

<p>Hi {{first<em>name}},</p>

<p>Quick market update for Chester County buyers:</p>

<strong>The 3 Things You Need to Know Right Now:</strong>

<strong>1. Inventory is Up</strong>
<p>We're seeing 20% more listings than this time last year. More choices, less bidding wars.</p>

<strong>2. Rates Have Stabilized</strong>
<p>We're sitting around 6% — not the 3% pandemic days, but way better than the 7%+ spike last year. Buyers are adjusting.</p>

<strong>3. You Have Negotiating Power</strong>
<p>For the first time in years, strategic buyers can negotiate. That means price reductions, closing cost credits, and inspection contingencies are back on the table.</p>

<strong>What This Means for {{profile</em>name}} Buyers Like You:</strong>

<p>[Dynamic paragraph based on profile]</p>

<strong>Example for Minimalist:</strong>
<p>If you're looking for modern, low-maintenance homes in walkable areas, this is your moment. West Chester Borough inventory is up, and sellers are motivated.</p>

<strong>Want to Talk Strategy?</strong>

<p>If you're thinking about making a move in the next 3-6 months, now's the time to get pre-approved and start touring. The spring rush hasn't hit yet.</p>

<h2>Sequence 3: Hot Follow-Up (3 emails) — HOT LEADS ONLY</h2>

<h3>Email 3.1: Personal Outreach (Day 3)</h3>

<strong>Subject:</strong> {{first</em>name}}, let's find your home this month

<strong>Preview Text:</strong> You said ASAP — here's how we make that happen

<strong>Send Timing:</strong> Day 3 (hot leads only)

<strong>Body:</strong>

<p>Hi {{first<em>name}},</p>

<p>I saw you're looking to move soon (like, really soon). Let's make that happen.</p>

<p>Here's the plan:</p>

<strong>Step 1: Get Pre-Approved (If You Haven't Already)</strong>

<p>If you need a lender recommendation, I've got 3 who move fast and don't jerk you around. Reply with "lender" and I'll intro you.</p>

<strong>Step 2: Tour Homes This Week</strong>

<p>Based on your {{profile</em>name}} wishlist, I've pulled 5-7 properties we should see in person. Some just hit the market. Some won't last the week.</p>

<p>[VIEW YOUR CUSTOM TOUR LIST →]</p>

<strong>Step 3: Make an Offer When You're Ready</strong>

<p>No games. No pressure. Just strategic guidance on price, contingencies, and how to win in a competitive situation (if it comes to that).</p>

<strong>When Can We Tour?</strong>

<p>Reply with your availability this week or next. Morning, afternoon, evening — we'll make it work.</p>

<p>Or just call me: (610) 324-9416</p>

<p>Let's find your home,</p>

<p>Sharra Mercer</p>
<p>The Gary Mercer Team</p>

<p>P.S. — Serious question: What's driving your urgency? Job relocation? Lease ending? Growing family? Knowing this helps me prioritize the right homes.</p>

<h3>Email 3.2: New Listing Alert (Day 7)</h3>

<strong>Subject:</strong> NEW: {{profile<em>name}} home just listed in [Neighborhood] 🚨

<strong>Preview Text:</strong> This one checks all your boxes — but it won't last

<strong>Send Timing:</strong> Day 7 (hot leads only)

<strong>Body:</strong>

<p>Hi {{first</em>name}},</p>

<p>This just hit the market an hour ago and it screams {{profile<em>name}}.</p>

<strong>[Address, Neighborhood]</strong>
<p>$XXX,XXX | X beds, X baths | X sq ft</p>

<strong>Why This Matches Your Wishlist:</strong>

<p>✓ [Must-have 1 from their selections]</p>
<p>✓ [Must-have 2 from their selections]</p>
<p>✓ [Must-have 3 from their selections]</p>
<p>✓ [Neighborhood match]</p>
<p>✓ [Budget match]</p>

<strong>The Catch:</strong>

<p>It's priced right, it's move-in ready, and inventory in this range is tight. I'm guessing we'll see multiple offers by the weekend.</p>

<strong>Want to See It?</strong>

<p>I can get you in today or tomorrow. Reply with your availability or call me: (610) 324-9416.</p>

<p>[SEE PHOTOS & DETAILS →]</p>

<p>If this isn't the one, no worries. But I wanted you to see it before everyone else does.</p>

<strong>Deliverability:</strong> Plain text with light HTML formatting. No heavy images. Sender: "Sharra Mercer | The Gary Mercer Team" for recognition.
